Then change into your new `CrimeTracker` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

to run an existing build on your local machine using an NPM server(recommended)

```bash
cd CrimeTracker
npm install
npm start
```

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server. You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
